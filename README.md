# INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON
by Jing Xue, Rich Parker and Jessica Novillo Argudo

-----

### General Overview
This unit introduces text-based programming to students using the programming language Python. It provides an overview of the tools available in Python, such as the basic commands, data types, variables, conditional statements, functions, loops, and simple data structures. At the end of the unit, students will have the skills that will help them develop programs where they will show what they learned in the unit. 

This unit would serve as a final unit for the APCSP course and be introduced right after the AP Exam.

### Motivation for Unit
We decided to make this unit because some students would take an APCSA course next year, and it could be difficult for them to transition from Snap! (block-based) to a text-based programming language, Java. Especially after the AP Exam, students could use Python to learn to program and maybe create games or artwork.
