### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
Introdcution of Python. It will serve a final unit for the couse of CSP after the AP Exam.

---

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
We decided to make this unit was because that some of the students would take CSA next year and it could be difficult for them to transition from Snap!(block-based) to a text-based programming language, Java. Specially after the AP Exam, students could use Python to learn some programming and maybe create their games or art work.
