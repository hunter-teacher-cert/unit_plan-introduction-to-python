### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
Introdcution of Python. It will serve a final unit for the couse of CSP after the AP Exam.

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
Xue: I decided to make this unit was because that some of my students would take CSA next year and it could be difficult for them to transition from Snap!(block-based) to a text-based programming language, Java. Specially after the AP Exam, students could use Python to learn some text based programming and maybe create their games or art work.
